# Hello ImGui


Hello ImGui is a library designed to make multiplatform app development as simple as writing a "Hello World" program, built on top of [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

Its flexibility makes it suited for complex applications, as well as for simple prototypes; allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of your projects.

## Features

**Multiplatform utilities**
* Seamlessly multiplatform: supports Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Emscripten with minimal setup (1 line of CMake code)
* Asset embedding across all platforms  (no code required)
* Effortless app customization, including app icons and names for mobile platforms (no code required)
* Universal application icon customization, extending to mobile and macOS (no code required)

**Dear ImGui Tweaks**
* Power Save mode: optimize performance by reducing FPS when idle
* High DPI support: automatically scales UI to match screen DPI on any platform.
* Enhanced layout handling: dockable windows and multiple layouts for complex UIs
* Window geometry utilities: autosize application window, restore app window position
* Theme tweaking: extensive list of additional themes
* Support for movable and resizable borderless windows
* Advanced font support: icons, emojis and colored fonts
* Integration with ImGui Test Engine: automate and test your apps
* Save user settings: window position, layout, opened windows, theme, user defined custom settings
* Easily add a custom 3D background to your app 

**Backends**
* Available platform backends: SDL2, Glfw3
* Available rendering backends: OpenGL3, Metal, Vulkan, DirectX


## Demos & real world apps

### Motto

The minimum code to start developing a GUI app should be... minimal. Here is a multiplatform Hello World in 7 lines.

*6 lines of C++*
```cpp
#include "hello_imgui/hello_imgui.h"
int main(int , char *[]) {
    HelloImGui::Run(
        []{ ImGui::Text("Hello, world!"); }, // Gui code
        "Hello!", true);                     // Window title + Window size auto
}
```

*1 line of CMake*
```cmake
hello_imgui_add_app(hello_world hello_world.cpp)
```


### Advanced layout

The docking demo show how to handle complex layouts, use themes, store user settings, reduce FPS and CPU usage when idling, load fonts and icons, and much more
